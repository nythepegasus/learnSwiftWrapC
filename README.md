# Learning Swift/C interop
TLDR Swift is dumb!

### Brief Background
So it seems that when a C `struct` is defined in a .c file, Swift has no clue what it is, but if it's defined in the .h it's all good. This is a small repository to specifically figure that small tidbit out since I can't really find anything about this anywhere else.


Gonna presume most people go the xcframework route for this type of stuff, but I want to see/learn Swift/C interop across platforms.
